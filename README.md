# Data Analysis Project

Welcome to this Data Analysis Project! This repository showcases my skills in data analysis, data visualization, and data preprocessing. 
The primary goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my proficiency in extracting insights from datasets and providing actionable recommendations.

Keep in mind that most of the codes and comments in this notebook were written or rewritten with the help of ChatGPT.

## Dataset

For this analysis, I have used the [Spotify Most Streamed Songs 2023 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023). You can access the dataset on Kaggle to explore it further.

## Notebook Overview

In this notebook, I approach the analysis as if I were working for stakeholders seeking answers to key questions about Spotify's top-performing songs and artists in 2023. The analysis covers a wide range of topics, including:

- Identifying the most streamed songs and artists of 2023.
- Investigating correlations between song features and stream counts.
- Exploring the impact of song release times on stream counts.
- Building a machine learning model to predict stream counts based on song features.
