# Movie Subtitle Collection and Alignment

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the process of collecting movie subtitle data from Subscene.com and aligning them to create parallel subtitle files for pairs of languages. 


**Overview:**

The notebook covers several key functionalities:
- Searching for movie subtitles based on their titles from Subscene.com
- Downloading, unzipping, and aligning subtitle files for language pairs
- Creating parallel subtitle files with 2 alignment methods

The code and procedures outlined here offer a valuable resource for those interested in training machine translation models or conducting research in natural language processing.

The dataset created through this process is available on Kaggle and Hugging Face for use in machine learning projects or research purposes.
