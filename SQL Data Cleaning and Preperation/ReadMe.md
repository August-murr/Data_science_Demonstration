# SQL Data Cleaning, Preparation, and Tableau Visualization

## Overview

This SQL project focuses on data cleaning, preparation, and visualization using Google BigQuery, Jupyter Notebook, and Tableau. The dataset used in this project was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yapwh1208/supermarket-sales-data/data) and consists of multiple tables, including sales records, item names, codes, and more. The data was downloaded into Google Drive and accessed using Google BigQuery through a Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following components:

- **Jupyter Notebook**: A Jupyter Notebook is used to access data from Google BigQuery and display the results as pandas dataframes. The notebook serves as the central hub for data analysis and includes SQL queries, data cleaning, and exploration steps.

- **Tableau Visualizations**: Tableau was employed to create interactive and insightful visualizations based on the cleaned and prepared data. The Tableau visualization links can be found within the Jupyter Notebook.

- **SQL Scripts**: All SQL scripts used for data cleaning, preparation, and analysis have been compiled into a single script for reference. You can view the entire SQL script to understand the data manipulation and analysis steps taken in the project.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are as follows:

- Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Answer key questions through SQL queries and data manipulation.
- Create meaningful and informative visualizations using Tableau.
- Showcase SQL skills in data cleaning, preparation, and analysis to potential recruiters.
