# Data Collection and Web Scraping for Machine Translation

In the quest to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for movie translation and subtitle generation, this Jupyter notebook explores data collection and web scraping from various online sources, including IMDb, Subscene, and ScriptSlug. The primary focus is to gather contextual data that these models can learn from.

## Key Tasks

The notebook covers several important tasks:

1. **Collecting Movie Subtitles**: The process of assembling movie subtitles in multiple languages based on specific queries.
2. **Collecting Movie Metadata**: Retrieving essential movie details from IMDb, offering insights into each movie.
3. **Fetching Movie Synopses**: Gathering movie synopses, which provide a concise summary of the plot.
4. **Obtaining Movie Scripts**: Accessing detailed textual representations of movie dialogues and scenes by acquiring movie scripts.
5. **Speech Recognition**: Converting audio content from movie scenes into text by transcribing spoken words.

## Code and Function Explanations

Every piece of code and each function in this notebook is thoughtfully explained. This ensures that you understand not only what the code does but also why it's crucial for data collection and preprocessing.

## Utilization of the Gathered Data

The data collected through these functions serves a pivotal role. It can be harnessed for various applications, including training or pretraining of machine translation models. Additionally, the gathered data contributes to prompt engineering, helping the models understand tone, vocabulary usage, and personalization of outputs.

This notebook empowers you with the tools and knowledge needed to collect diverse and informative data for enhancing machine translation models.
